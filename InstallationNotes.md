This is a DCS AH-64D Apache Helios Profile utilising new features from Helios [16.5306.4] (https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest).  It has a reasonably complete pilot and CP/G cockpit, and for best functionality, It  needs [Iris Screen Exporter](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Iris-Screen-Exporter/releases/latest) and the KeyPressReceiver (if running Helios Control Center remotely **or** running a profile which supports dual cockpits).

There are new single cockpit profiles for the CP/G and Pilot, and there is a new dual cockpit profile for running on single PC set-ups.  This also comes with new Iris configurations for a 3 way horizontal 1920x1080 monitor setup.  If a Reset Monitors command is issued to change the monitor setup or scale, then it is the user's responsibility to adjust the Iris configurations.

## New in this release
* 

### Note
The Dual Cockpit profile for a single PC is non-trivial to configure and should be avoided unless you can be considered as an Expert Helios user.  Due to the challenges of setting this up correctly it is definitely not recommended for those unwilling to spend time learning about Iris and Helios.

See [Wiki page](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/DCS-AH-64D-Profile/wiki/Dual-Cockpit---Single-PC-Profile---Apache_Local.hpf) for a little more information.
